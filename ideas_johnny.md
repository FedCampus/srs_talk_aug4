1. I started participating in an SRS project as a system developer and sysadmin, excited to learn DevOps skills. 
2. My first task was configuring Docker and setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications. 
3. I encountered some initial issues connecting to Docker Hub but managed to build and push the Docker image successfully.
4. I finalized the Docker structure, automated the CI pipeline, expanded server resources, and started on uWSGI. 
5. I outlined my short term goal of completing uWSGI and long term goal of configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy. 
6. The initial deployment went well and I subsequently automated weekly server maintenance tasks. 
7. My plan moving forward was to add Docker environment variable support in the short term, and implement uWSGI in the long term.
8. I continued to develop the project and the CI/CD pipeline was ready to be merged. I updated the Dockerfile, spun up a VM for ML work, and started on the environment variable support.
9. My next short term plan was finishing the environment variable support and setting up Nginx. My long term goal remained integrating uWSGI into the production Docker image. 
10. Overall, it was an invaluable learning experience that gave me hands-on DevOps skills. I'm proud of the progress I made over the summer!
