- I started participating in an SRS project as a system developer and sysadmin, excited to learn DevOps skills.
- My first task was configuring Docker and setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications.
- I encountered some initial issues connecting to Docker Hub but managed to build and push the Docker image successfully.
- I finalized the Docker structure, automated the CI pipeline, expanded server resources, and started on uWSGI.
- I outlined my short term goal of completing uWSGI and long term goal of configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy.
- The initial deployment went well and I subsequently automated weekly server maintenance tasks.
- My plan moving forward was to add Docker environment variable support in the short term, and implement uWSGI in the long term.
- I continued to develop the project and the CI/CD pipeline was ready to be merged. I updated the Dockerfile, spun up a VM for ML work, and started on the environment variable support.
- My next short term plan was finishing the environment variable support and setting up Nginx. My long term goal remained integrating uWSGI into the production Docker image.
- Overall, it was an invaluable learning experience that gave me hands-on DevOps skills. I'm proud of the progress I made over the summer!
