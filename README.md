# FedCampus: A Federated Learning & Federated Analytics Experiment on DKU Campus

## Introducing Federated Learning (FL)

### Motivation

- Centralized ML tend to invade privacy land.
- ML at large scales using privacy data is very useful.

### How FL works

- Analogy: the Federated Government.

## Health data and privacy

- Tremendously useful yet sensitive use case.

### Case study: sleep efficiency prediction (Aicha)

## Mobile FL on DKU campus

- Nobody has solved mobile FL. Doing mobile FL research sucks.
- Mobile FL is crucial. Everyone relies on their phone so much.

### Starting point: FedCampus App (Beilong)

### Physical infrastructure (Johnny)

## How you can engage with us

- We are looking for collaboration using FL.
- We are continuously looking for new members.
- We will soon be looking for participants in our experiments.
